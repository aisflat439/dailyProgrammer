Happy Monday! This coding challenge showed up in my DM's! Have you sent me a DM with a coding challenge yet? You totes should.
Coding Test : Hamming Distance
Write a program that can calculate the Hamming distance between two DNA strands.
A mutation is simply a mistake that occurs during the creation or copying of a nucleic acid, in particular DNA. Because nucleic acids are vital to cellular functions, mutations tend to cause a ripple effect throughout the cell. Although mutations are technically mistakes, a very rare mutation may equip the cell with a beneficial attribute. In fact, the macro effects of evolution are attributable by the accumulated result of beneficial microscopic mutations over many generations.
The simplest and most common type of nucleic acid mutation is a point mutation, which replaces one base with another at a single nucleotide.
By counting the number of differences between two homologous DNA strands taken from different genomes with a common ancestor, we get a measure of the minimum number of point mutations that could have occurred on the evolutionary path between the two strands.
This is called the “Hamming Distance”.

The Hamming distance between these two DNA strands is 7.

Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

Happy Friday. Time for the Friday Challenge! Visit (https://github.com/aisflat439/dailyProgrammer/blob/master/data/realEstate.csv) and grab the CSV and get ready to do some work! You're helping a friend relocate to Sacramento and they want to know which house offers the best price per square foot. *No problem?* Bonus challenge: Write a program that returns the best price per square foot for Northernmost, Southernmost, Easternmost or Westernmost homes.

Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

The word `chimps` is an example of a word that's in alphabetical order. Write a program that prints out if the word is in alphabetical order. For bonus make it test backwards too!

`[abort, times, alloy, taught, arrow, know, below, onscreen, berry, idea, cello, spoonfeed, asked, deist, worlds, feint, best, floss, suggest, hilly, hippy]`

Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

Happy Thursday!



Today's daily programmer challenge is to test a magic square. This challenge is stolen verbatim from r/dailyprogrammer. A 3x3 magic square is a 3x3 grid of the numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and major diagonal adds up to 15. Here's an example:
```
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```
When given the inputs arrays, you should get:
[8, 1, 6, 3, 5, 7, 4, 9, 2] => true
[2, 7, 6, 9, 5, 1, 4, 3, 8] => true
[3, 5, 7, 8, 1, 6, 4, 9, 2] => false
[8, 1, 6, 7, 5, 3, 4, 9, 2] => false

Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

Happy Wednesday!


Today's daily programmer challenge is to print a marathon finishers place in English. Your program should take an non decimal input `getFinishPosition(11)` and return `11th place`, `getFinishPosition(21)` and return `21st place`, `getFinishPosition(4)` and return `4th place`, and `getFinishPosition(33)` and return `33rd place`.
Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution. No need to go over 99 finishers, unless you want to.

Happy Tuesday!



Good morning! Today's daily programmer is about arrays and sorting.  This gist of this question came from a friends recent interview. It may be a relatively familiar task. Feel free to write the solution in two different ways to challenge yourself, or use a different language. Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

Happy Monday!

```
Merge the following two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

arrayOne = [ 2, 9, 22, 97, 167, 204 ]
arrayTwo = [ 3, 7, 10, 22, 98, 188, 203, 205, 209, 215]
```
