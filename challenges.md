Good morning! Today's daily programmer is about arrays and sorting.  This gist of this question came from a friends recent interview. It may be a relatively familiar task. Feel free to write the solution in two different ways to challenge yourself, or use a different language. Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

*if you have a question about someones solution please use a thread under their posted link*

Happy Monday!

```
Merge the following two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

arrayOne = [ 2, 9, 22, 97, 167, 204 ]
arrayTwo = [ 3, 7, 10, 22, 98, 188, 203, 205, 209, 215]
```


Today's daily programmer challenge is to print a marathon finishers place in english (Or any language you might like). Your program should take an non decimal input (`getFinishPosition(11)`) and return `11th place`.
Please DM me with ideas for future problems. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.
