*Happy Thursday daily_programmer*

Today continues a multi part program. Your program needs this (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt) list of words.

Please write a program that stores most frequent letters in the word set. Then create a function that returns all words of similar length and length + 1, sorting the returned words alphabetically and by how many of the most frequent letters they contain.

Something like:
```
getSimilarWordsByFrequency("foo");
// This might return, fox, fix, and fun;
=>  fun // comes first because u and n have higher frequency than ix or ox in the word set
    fix // Is in alphabetical order if the frequency is similar
    fox
```


Please DM me with ideas for future problems or future themed weeks. When you have completed it post a link to your solution.

*if you have a question about someones solution please use a thread under their posted link. I could absolutely use some challenge problems if you have some.*

*Happy Tuesday daily_programmer*

Today begins a multi part program. Your program needs this (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt) list of words.

Please write a program that takes a word and returns all of the words of the same length, that start with the same letter.

Those three numbers should(?) add up to 10k. I haven't tested
