Some of you maybe already solved this _cough_ mika _cough_ noah _cough_ nonetheless...

Given an array find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

findSetsOfFour([1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], 0)

```
[-1,  0, 0, 1]
[-2, -1, 1, 2]
[-2,  0, 0, 2]
```

Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.

```
// note the first 10 passed to the function is the digit we are finding.
function findDigit(10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
returns => 0
```

Find the _longest sorted sub array_ of an array. Return it's length and values.

```
findSubArray([3, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 2, 4])

=> 4, [1, 4, 6, 7]

your answer should handle this test case
findSubArray([11, 0, 8, 18, 99, 0, 2, 3, 4, 1])
```

Test for word patterns. Given a `pattern` and a `string`, find if the string follows the same pattern, broken by `' '`.

```
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return true.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish" should return false.
pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog" should return false.
pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog" should return false.
```

A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. The function should return the number of arithmetic slices in the array.

For example, these are arithmetic sequence:

```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```

The following sequence is not arithmetic.

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

_Example_
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```
